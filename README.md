These websites will be useful for you.


### IMPORTANT: All pages will only have doctype and html in it please add the necessary tags (i.e. body, head etc.)

## Test 1: (Use Static 1 for this test)

I want to see a basic html setup showing me a title some text and a picture of your choice, this page should have a custom title in the tabs, i would like to see the text change font from in a second paragraph and have a link and/or button take me to google. (use only html)

## Test 2: (Use Static 2 for this test)

I would like to see a new file structure, all website links go into a folder called templates and I want a new folder and file called stylesheet.css to be in a folder called static/css. I then want you to link the (all) pages with the stylesheet in that folder. I would like to see on that webpage a new picture but resized from a class in the stylesheet. I would like then for the text to have borders and padding to them. I would like to see a link show up as red but with no underline but to have it change colour slightly on hover. I would like to see a button that redirects to the first and third pages. (add to Static1 also).

## Test 3: (Use all Pages for this test)

I would like to see "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" used to link as a stylesheet as well as the one made by you, and I would like a script to be added "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" then I would like you to use these to add some bootstrap classes to style up the webpage add div's to help with these, see the bottom for an example of how to make a justified button but make sure the buttons link to the relevant pages. I would like to see a video from youtube added in (recommend using a Land Registry video) and for that to have a border. I would like then for the finishing touches to have the text appear in 2 columns for each paragraph and for them to be included in a panel with the headings as you choose. If you wish to add more customised things from bootstrap or your own stylings go for it.
